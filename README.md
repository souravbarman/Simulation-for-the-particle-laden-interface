# Simulation-for-the-particle-laden-interface
Interfacial particles, evidently microparticles, interact with each other in different ways, which fall into three unique categories: electrostatic, capillary and Casimir. Electrostatic and capillary effects usually couple together through the deformability of the fluid interface. Levine et al., initially pioneered on this field from theoretical and experimental point of view. In my study, I will focus our concentration on electrostatic and capillary interaction.

#Approach
Using Newtons 2nd law and balancing drag force with the electrostatic and capillary forces, generic equation is derived for small delta t. We started with symmetrically placed particle and apply 2nd law and iterate it untill the energy passes the minimum threshold. 

Code 2(rev 7).py and Code 2(rev 8).py are the base code for generating results. 
Graph.py and utilities.py was used for producing different typeof graphs. 
Text files named equilibrated are used for input and output for the simulation. 
Figures file are also generated through those code as an output. 
Voronoi.py is special code that can create voronoi diagrams.
MD_coll_int3.m is a similar analysis but done in nondimensional form. 
Different .pptx and .pdf fils represents  the data all together so that it make sense.
